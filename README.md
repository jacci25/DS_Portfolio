# Jingcheng- Academic Individual and Group Projects
This is a file that cover all the projects that I have done during my Master of Applied Data Science at University of Canterbury.

## Individual Project
### Project 1:Crime Data Analysis and Visualisation

#### Description

This project analyzes crime data in New Zealand to identify trends and relationships.

#### Key Features

Preprocessed and analyzed 25,000 rows of crime data using Python (Pandas).
Identified primary crime types and explored correlations between crime types, age, and ethnicity.
Developed informative data visualizations using Matplotlib to communicate findings effectively.
Created an interactive data visualization interface using Tkinter for exploring crime trends and demographics.

#### Tech Stack

Python (Pandas)
Matplotlib
Tkinter


### Project 2:GHCN Data Analysis using Spark

### Project 3:Million Song Dataset using Spark

### Project 4:Neural Network

## Group Projects
### Project 5:Data Wrangling Group Project(R shiny)

### Project 6:Road Safety Analysis with Machine Learning and Data Visualization
#### Description

This project investigates factors influencing car crash severity in New Zealand using machine learning and data visualization.

#### Key Findings

Analyzed 10,000 rows of car crash data using machine learning (Random Forest) in R to identify key factors contributing to accident severity.
Developed data visualizations (using Tableau) to explore crash trends by region, victim demographics, and time (monthly/hourly).
Insights generated actionable recommendations for improving road safety measures.
