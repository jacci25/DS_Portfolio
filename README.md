# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio contains my projects and exercises relevant to data analytics, data visualisation, data wrangling and machine learning.

## Projects
### Project 1: Crime Data Analysis and Visualisation

Used Python to preprocess and analyse crime data from NZ Police to identify trends and relationships, then created an interactive data visualization interface for exploring crime trends and demographics.

**Tech Stack**

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter

### Project 2: Million Song Dataset using Spark

Used Apache Spark to handle large and complex song data sets to build a system for music recommendations. 

Built machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees) to predict song genre.

Implemented Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factorization with collaborative filtering using Spark to recommend songs.

**Tech Stack**

Python: Apache Spark, Pandas, Seaborn

### Project 3: Fashion-MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

Used Google Colab and Python to explore neural network architectures for classifying fashion items in the Fashion-MNIST dataset, experimenting with hyperparameter tuning and convolutional neural networks(CNNs).

**Tech Stack**

Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Optuna

### Project 4: Data Wrangling Group Project

Used R and Julia to wrangle and clean the data and then to analyse the impact of schools and crime rates on housing prices in New Zealand.

Created the relational data model among various data sets(NZ school directory, crime data, housing price data, population estimates, territorial authority polygonsby) using the territorial authority as the primary key.

**Tech Stack**

- Julia - http package
- R - tidyverse packages, sf library
- R Shiny
- use of GitHub for version control and collaboration

### Project 5: Road Safety Analysis with Machine Learning and Data Visualization


This project investigates factors influencing car crash severity in New Zealand using machine learning and data visualization.

Used machine learning (Random Forest) in R to identify key factors contributing to accident severity.

Used Tableau to explore crash trends by region, victim demographics, and time (monthly/hourly).

Generated actionable recommendations for improving road safety measures.

**Tech Stack**

- R
- Tableau
